# Escape Room Story: Introduction

You are a software engineer who has recently joined the team. Today is your first day, and you are shadowing a support engineer during a critical business period. Your task is to monitor the production services, ensuring everything runs smoothly.

The support engineer provides you with the API endpoint:

- **Endpoint:** http://localhost:3000/
- **Username:** john.smith@example.com
- **Password:** S3cr3t!

The support engineer explains that your responsibility is to monitor the key services over the next few hours, checking every 5-10 minutes. They share their screen, displaying the monitoring dashboard, and walk you through the process.

Suddenly, the call drops, and the support engineer goes offline. Now, without access to the monitoring dashboard, you can only rely on checking the API directly to ensure the services are running as expected.

With the next check-in expected by management soon, it's up to you to recover the service status. Open your favourite HTTP API client or a terminal and use curl to interact with the API. Can you figure out the current state of the services before your next report is due?
